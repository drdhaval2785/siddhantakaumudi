1. Downloaded Siddhanta Kaumudi - Text only.zip file from mail of Dr. H. N. Bhat dated 26 Dec 2016.
2. Extracted and copy pasted in siddhantakaumudi.txt (This is base copy in which there will not be any change.)
3. Created a copy of it in sk0.txt.
4. There are misorders in this file. So created a list of misordered sUtra numbers in step1_notes.txt and made corrections in sk0.txt.
